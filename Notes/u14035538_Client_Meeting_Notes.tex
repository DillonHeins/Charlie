\section{General Vision}\label{sec:vision}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A system which allows researchers at the University of Pretoria (specifically within the Computer Science Department) to keep track of the publications which they are currently working on.
		\item This system must also keep track of historical publications so as to allow researchers to maintain a history of their work.
		\item The system should allow the heads of the research groups to manage their group's papers as well as to keep track of all publications under their group.
		\item The head of the Computer Science department, within this system, should be able to view all research groups so as to enable him/her to manage the department's research goals.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Users}\label{sec:users}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of users:
		\begin{itemize}
