	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
		\subsection{Purpose}\label{subsec:purpose}
			The purpose of this document is to give a detailed explanation and description of the P.A.P.E.R.S system. This document will illustrate the purpose as well as the features of said system, the interfaces of the system, the functionality of the system, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will integrate with external systems. This document has been created for use by the developers of the system, the proposed client as well as any other additional third party collaborators who require to understand the software specifications of the P.A.P.E.R.S system.
		
	\cleardoublepage	
	\section{Vision}\label{sec:vision}
		The client has requested a system which allows researchers at the \textit{University of Pretoria}, specifically within the Computer Science Department, to keep track of the publications which they are currently actively involved with or working on.
		
		The system is required to keep track of historical publications so as to allow researches to maintain an archive of their work.
		
		The system should support the management of the multiple research groups within the department as well as allow the acting heads of the individual research groups to manage their group's members and publications.
		
		Ultimately this system is to be used by the acting Head of Department so as to be able to view all the research groups and their research output. It is a way for the department to ensure that the researchers are meeting their goals as well as the department's goals so as to ensure future funding for the department.\\
		[5mm]
		The typical usage scenarios for the desired output from this system would be:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A UP staff member submitting a research paper to a conference, technical report or conference.
			\item The submission and acceptance of such a paper is what allows researchers to earn units.
			\item These units correspond with academic prestige as well as funding for the University of Pretoria and its researchers.
			\item Departments have predetermined goals which they set out to achieve each academic year.
			\item The ultimate desired output from this system is the ability to monitor the CS Department's researchers and their contribution towards earning these units.
			\item This allows the acting Head of Department to award researchers who achieve as well as take note of those who do not.
			% Desired output is also terminated papers - indicates who is not working
		\end{itemize}
	\cleardoublepage
	\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
		Reasons for the development of this project include but are not limited to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Research opportunities:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Through the monitoring of units earned by staff members it enables the progression of research opportunities for the \textit{University of Pretoria's} Computer Science Department. By monitoring units earned the department is able to ensure that it meets its goals and is able to secure funding opportunities.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Opportunities to simplify some aspect of work:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The method in use by the department currently is to have all researchers edit the same Microsoft Excel document as their manner of managing and tracking publications and units earned.
				\item This method is inefficient as well as error prone and has hence lead to the need to create this system as a means to replace it.
				\item This system aims to allow for all researchers to be able to manage their own publications in their own user space. It also allows for the Head of Department to no longer have to use an Excel document to create reports from, instead he/she would be able to use the system to the work for him/her in a far more accurate and efficient manner.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Problems the client is currently facing:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The problem of having all members of a department trying to collaborate on a single Excel document.
				\item The problem of having personal and academic information visible to all who have access to this document.
				\item The problem of managing this data in such a way as to get valuable and meaningful information out of it quickly and accurately.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Architecture Requirements}\label{sec:architecture}
		\subsection{Access Channel Requirements}\label{subsec:access}
			The different access channels through which the system's services will be made available to users as well as other systems are as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
			  \item An Application Program Interface residing on a server which will be interfaced with by clients in order to supply services to them. Clients referring to:
			  \begin{itemize}
			  	\item Human users via an interface
			  	\item External systems using the services provided by the API
			  \end{itemize}
			  \item Human users can interface with the system via the use of:
			  \begin{itemize}
			  	\item a web-based application service
			  	\item an android based mobile application
			  \end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
			The interface is required to be lightweight.
		
		\subsection{Quality Requirements}\label{subsec:quality}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Performance
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Workload is a maximum of 100 users concurrently.
					\item No implementation of concurrent editing of document entries - last saved edit is written to the database.
					\item The system should be able to support 100 users updating information at the same time as updating is more intensive than reading.
					\item The response time of the system should be fast enough that a user is able to complete their work without frustration. Due to the system being off-line it is reasonable to expect the system's response time to be only limited by the speed of the network.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Reliability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The system should not fail whilst providing critical or important use cases.
					\item The system should not fail at all within a time period of at least 6 months.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Scalability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Ability for multiple external systems to connect to the system's API.
					\item The system should be able to support a large amount of historical document entries being added to the database.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Security
				\begin{itemize}
					\item A hierarchical system will be used to determine the security privileges of users of the system.
					\item Passwords are to be hashed using at least sha256 and should be stored as such within the database along with a salt.
					\item An inactive user session should be terminated after a period of 10 minutes with no activity.
					\item A user who has forgotten their passwords can use a password reset option which will send a one time password to their registered email address so that they may login once using it and reset their password.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Flexibility
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The client has stated that the system is not needed to be able to extend to accommodate a greater number of departments.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Maintainability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The system should have as few bugs as possible so as to prevent having to constantly maintain it in the future.
					\item The system should be built in a modular way so that all services are decoupled in such a manner that allows for the extension of the system at a later stage.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Auditability/monitorability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Every action performed by a user should be logged and all details about said action should be stored.
					\item These actions should be visible to admin users.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Integrability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item User's document entries should not be able to be deleted, if it is a case where the document will not be completed it should remain in the system and be terminated.
					\item A user with no admin rights should not have access to admin privileges so that the system's data may remain integrable and safe.
					\item The system should not ever be in a state where it is under pressure and the data is at risk of becoming corrupted. The system should be designed to handle the pressure for which it has been specified to handle.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Cost
				\begin{itemize}
					\item All software used should not be proprietary but rather open source so as to minimise cost as much as possible.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Usability
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The interface should be lightweight.
					\item The interface should be intuitive to use as well as obey Human Computer Interaction guidelines so that it is efficient and easy to use.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Integration Requirements}\label{subsec:integration}
			\begin{itemize}
			  	\item The first item
			  	\item The second item
			  	\item The third etc \ldots
			\end{itemize}
		
		\subsection{Architecture Constraints}\label{subsec:constraints}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The system will be a web based program accessible via browser with an API for Android access.
			  	\item The system may not be browser or operating system specific, and should be able to run on any system chosen.
			  	\item The system should be handled locally and should not rely on outside internet sources in order to function.
		  		\item The database used must be a relational database as the information being stored requires both a standard structure as well as relations on fields.
		  		\item Modules must be decoupled as far as possible, allowing as much pluggability and further editing as need be when the system grows larger.
	  			\item A proper framework such as Django will probably be used in favour of a standard PHP approach during the program's design.
	  			\item The technology used may not be proprietary and should be free and available to use for all.
			\end{itemize}
