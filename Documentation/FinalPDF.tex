	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
	P.A.P.E.R.S (Publication and Papers Electronic Repository System), a project proposed by the University of Pretoria's department of Computer Science, is a system dedicated to the management of research and publication records. The objective of the system is to create an environment where users of the system can maintain a list of publications belonging to them and where supervisors, such as a research leader or head of department, can oversee progress of said users. Users can belong to research groups and maintain a record of who contributed to a publication and thus the system is able to maintain and track the units earned by a user of the system for their publications. Only members of the department of Computer Science can be users of the system. 
	
	\subsection{General Uses}\label{subsec:generaluses}
		General uses of this system should include keeping track of:
            \begin{itemize}  
            
                \item Research papers and publications created by users of the system.
                \item Reporting.
                \item Research Groups.
                \item Running Costs.
                \item All historical publications that have been created.
                \item List of authors that helped contribute to the publications.
                \item List of users of the system.
                \item Units and respective conferences that the publications belong to.
            \end{itemize}
		\subsection{Purpose}\label{subsec:purpose}
			This document serves to explore the minutiae and requirements of the P.A.P.E.R system. This is including but not limited to the overall features of the system, interfaces, functionality, constraints and integration. The intended purpose of the system is for the developers to be used as a reference tool and for the clients as an informative resource. Any third party collaborators who have a need to use a reference to the P.A.P.E.R system may also use this documentation.
		\subsection{Structure}\label{subsec:structure}
			The structure of the document is to allow an overview of the system through domain models, use-case diagrams, pre and post conditions and a general analysis of the system as a whole.
		
		
	\cleardoublepage	
	\section{Vision}\label{sec:vision}
		The client has requested a system which allows researchers at the \textit{University of Pretoria}, specifically within the Computer Science Department, to keep track of the publications which they are currently actively involved with or working on.
		
		The system is required to keep track of historical publications so as to allow researches to maintain an archive of their work.
		
		The system should support the management of the multiple research groups within the department as well as allow the acting heads of the individual research groups to manage their group's members and publications.
		
		Ultimately this system is to be used by the acting Head of Department so as to be able to view all the research groups and their research output. It is a way for the department to ensure that the researchers are meeting their goals as well as the department's goals so as to ensure future funding for the department.\\
		[5mm]
		The typical usage scenarios for the desired output from this system would be:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A UP staff member submitting a research paper to a conference, technical report or conference.
			\item The submission and acceptance of such a paper is what allows researchers to earn units.
			\item These units correspond with academic prestige as well as funding for the University of Pretoria and its researchers.
			\item Departments have predetermined goals which they set out to achieve each academic year.
			\item The ultimate desired output from this system is the ability to monitor the CS Department's researchers and their contribution towards earning these units.
			\item This allows the acting Head of Department to award researchers who achieve as well as take note of those who do not.
			% Desired output is also terminated papers - indicates who is not working
		\end{itemize}
	\cleardoublepage
	\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
		Reasons for the development of this project include but are not limited to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Research opportunities:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Through the monitoring of units earned by staff members it enables the progression of research opportunities for the \textit{University of Pretoria's} Computer Science Department. By monitoring units earned the department is able to ensure that it meets its goals and is able to secure funding opportunities.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Opportunities to simplify some aspect of work:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The method in use by the department currently is to have all researchers edit the same Microsoft Excel document as their manner of managing and tracking publications and units earned.
				\item This method is inefficient as well as error prone and has hence lead to the need to create this system as a means to replace it.
				\item This system aims to allow for all researchers to be able to manage their own publications in their own user space. It also allows for the Head of Department to no longer have to use an Excel document to create reports from, instead he/she would be able to use the system to do the work for him/her in a far more accurate and efficient manner.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Problems the client is currently facing:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The problem of having all members of a department trying to collaborate on a single Excel document.
				\item The problem of having personal and academic information visible to all who have access to this document.
				\item The problem of managing this data in such a way as to get valuable and meaningful information out of it quickly and accurately.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Open Issues}\label{sec:issues}
	Issues that weren't discussed in the client requirements meeting:
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Current representation and layout of system allows for only one department to use the system. Possible problem if system ever needs to expand.
		  \item What technologies and frameworks will we be using moving on in the next phases
		  \item Should each publication have its own super-user, with additional authority over the other users in the paper if said super-user created the paper.
		  \item Should people the administrator requests to aid in their work (e.g. secretaries and assistants) be allowed to receive administrator permissions in order to do certain tasks.
		  \item Should validation of meta data (Non-authentication checks) be handled client side (Ease of use and less hassle for simple validations) or server side (Less chance for SQL injections, JavaScript injections and the like.).
		  \item Will functionality for file storage, version control and such ever possibly be added to this system in the future.
		\end{itemize}
